subtitle: What is Systems NMR?
---

Systems NMR integrates Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy and mathematical modeling for quantitative visualization and analysis of medium-sized biomolecular networks (dozens of reactions). 
<!-- The concept was developed at [ETH Zürich](http://www.allainlab.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.html?persid=125247).

Key features of the method:
1. Combines dynamic resolution of biochemical assays and multiplexing ability of "omics" methods. This permits quantification of multiple network fluxes using single-sample measurements. Other ways of obtaining the same information require either multiple biochemical experiments - each resolving dozens of time-points for one network component in one sample, or multiple “omics” experiments - each resolving concentrations of multiple molecules, but only at one or a few time-points at a time.

2. Permits to quantify in one sample at the same time: all elementary reaction types (catalysis, bimolecular interactions, unimolecular state changes) and main biomolecule classes - e.g. Metabolites, Proteins, RNAs (provided these are ≥ 10 µM in concentration and ≤ 50-100 kDa in size).

3. Does not require chemical modification of the observed molecules (e.g. with fluorescent tags).
